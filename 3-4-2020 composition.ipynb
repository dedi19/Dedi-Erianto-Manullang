Emergency money is very important to have emergency money  but many people don’t prepare it or forget about how Important to have emergency money. How the way we prepare emergency money ? Let’s see in this situation in this now days when the bad Virus is coming attacked human being? They can even work and  end up with starving and confuse because they don’t have emergency money. Let’s see Indonesia Population 269 millions in 2020. All of them must stay at home and don’t do working. It is so terrible when Carona Virus is coming and all of people turned to stay home and working from home.Government promises to help but until today we don’t get any help and being confused what to do. We must realize how important to have emergency money when we work in a good situation. Emergency money should be    living cost in six months. For Example living cost in Medan 3000.000 3 millions per month  we must have emergency money     about  18.000.000IDR.We can save emergency money in the Bank or in Stock market or we buy gold. I my self right now realize how     important to have emergency money living cost for 6 months. At least we can withdraw that money when something happened to us.  We hope after this Carona end up we will start to have emergency money maybe 20% from Income. Carona virus teaches us about emergency money."
